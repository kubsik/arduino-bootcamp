Before you can  install the Android App on your Android device, you will need to change an option in your Android Settings.


Instructions on changing your settings to enable the app to be installed

Open the Settings app.
Tap the "Security" option in the Personal section.
Tap the checkbox next to Unknown Sources. This enables your device to install unsigned, third-party apps from sources other than the Google Play app store.
I created this Android app specifically to control this car via bluetooth.

After changing the option to install Unknown sources in settings, if you follow the link in your Android device, it will prompt you to install the app.

Launch the app when you are ready to control your car. The name of the app is "Bluetooth Car Controller".
