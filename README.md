Welcome to Arduino Bootcamp : Learning Through Projects. It is a hands-on projects-based approach to learning the Arduino platform that is meant to  take you from Novice to Professional. I’m Lee Assam, an Electrical Engineer, Professional Software Developer and University Instructor, but most importantly an electronics hobbyist. I have been tinkering with Arduino since its inception and teach university courses about it.

This course is meant to quickly get you up to speed with Arduino if you are not already familiar with it and make you a confident Arduino Prototyper.  You will become extremely familiar with the Arduino platform and will be able to undertake complex projects that demonstrate the power of Arduino. As an example, you will be able to build a remote controlled car that can be controlled via a smartphone app, a pan-tilt swivel controlled via a Wii Nunchuck and even an open source phone that you can make actual phone calls from and send text messages, using the Arduino.

Here’s how the course is designed, if you are new to Arduino, the first lessons will get you quickly up to speed on what the platform is and how to use it. You can then progress to simple projects which get you comfortable with basic electrical components.
For those already familiar with Arduino who want to take their skills to the next level, you can jump straight to the intermediate projects section. There we will focus on making game type projects using the Arduino and even an infrared repeater that can allow you to copy, store and playback any IR signal, just like your own universal remote.
Next, for those that might be already comfortable with Arduino, there is an advanced projects section where we tackle projects an like an online weather station, remote controlled car, open source phone and many more.

The ideal student for this course, is someone that is curious and willing to learn about Arduino and is interested in becoming a maker, inventor, entrepreneur, internet of things architect, or an electronics hobbyist looking to develop new ideas and prototypes. No previous programming or electronics knowledge is required. 

I have always believed that project-based learning is best approach where you actually learn by doing and building something that actually works. This is the approach I am taking in this course. I will explain all the electronics principles involved with each project, show you how to wire up the circuits and give a detailed line by line code reviews on how it all works. 

Thank you for your interest in the world of arduino. I look forward to being your guide and let’s make some cool projects together. What are you waiting for, join the Arduino bootcamp and let’s whip your Arduino skills into shape!
